    "description": "Hi, I'm Guy Farley. I'm a Software Developer with experience in full-stack JavaScript, and my background is in project management for marketing. I have a knack for thinking strategically, and my previous boss commended me for being able to see the bigger picture while identifying and solving the core issues. I'm a huge proponent of emotional intelligence, and I've always been able to build rapport with teammates and clients very quickly. This is why I was promoted to lead an account team at my previous company. I'm hoping to find a role in software development that will help me to grow as a coder and make a real contribution to a team. I've become very passionate about coding - I love the challenge and flexibility that it provides, and I want to use my skills to build tech that will have a positive impact on society.",

      "description": "This project was a part of my 201 coursework, and taught me several concepts, including: Data persistence through local storage, object constructor functions, event listeners and handlers, and using Chart to display data graphically. The app allows a user to choose their favorite of three different product images by clicking the image, and re-renders three new images for 25 rounds. Once voting is complete, the cumulative data is rendered to the screen as a Chart.",

      "description": "For my final 201 project, I worked with a team to develop an app that would allow the user to input criteria into a form and then return back to them a cocktail recipe that fit that criteria. The code uses a constructor function to create the recipe card objects, and a series of switch statements to determine the matching object. Each selected recipe is held in local storage and displayed in the My Cocktails page for the user.",
