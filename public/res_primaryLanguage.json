    "description": "Hi, I'm Guy Farley. I'm a Software Developer with experience in full-stack JavaScript, and my background is in project management for marketing. I have a knack for thinking strategically, and my previous boss commended me for being able to see the bigger picture while identifying and solving the core issues. I'm a huge proponent of emotional intelligence, and I've always been able to build rapport with teammates and clients very quickly. This is why I was promoted to lead an account team at my previous company. I'm hoping to find a role in software development that will help me to grow as a coder and make a real contribution to a team. I've become very passionate about coding - I love the challenge and flexibility that it provides, and I want to use my skills to build tech that will have a positive impact on society.",
